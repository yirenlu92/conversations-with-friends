### How do you view the differences between engineering and product roles?

I’m kind of unusual in that I don’t see engineering and product roles as super different. Some people might think if you're an engineer, you shouldn't be doing certain activities, or if you're a PM, you probably aren't very technical. However, I believe it's great when people can span a wide variety of skill sets and come up with unique connections and ideas that others might not think of. When knowledge is split between two people, there's always some overhead to transmitting information.

As an engineer, you can do many PM activities, and as a PM, you can get involved in building things. Some of the best product work comes from iterating, getting close to the engineering team, and working with engineers to make quick, cheap validations and get products to market quickly. At that point, the job starts to look like an engineer's, and the lines between the roles are blurred tactically.

Sometimes when founders come to me for advice about hiring product managers, I try to ask them if that role or function can be covered by people who are already on their team. For some teams, there may already be an engineer who is eager to step into this role. (The only caveat is that they may slightly underestimate what the role entails, so expectations need to be set very clearly.) The issue is that having a product manager on the team can sometimes disempower other team members.


### You made several switches, first from product/bizops at Dropbox to engineering at Airbnb, and then back to product at Lyft. What motivated these transitions?

It was pretty situational. When I was looking at Airbnb, there were no good product opportunities available - only super specialized PM roles like risk specialist or payment specialist. On the other hand, the Android team was trying to grow, and there were only ten people covering the entire product. Since I was curious about the transition to mobile, I thought it would be a great way to have a front-row seat into what was happening. 

In the end, the decision came down to wanting to learn more about mobile, and really wanting to work at Airbnb. The role was less of a factor.


### Then when I switched from engineering back to product, when I moved from Airbnb and Lyft, that was because I realized that career growth is challenging as an Android engineer. As an Android engineer, you can either be a framework specialist - someone very technical, or you can be a product generalist. As a product generalist, you just build lots of features and think about which features would be great. And I was very much in the product domain. But it was a very tricky space to be in, to be so good that people would keep promoting you, vs. someone who just really knows Kotlin.

When leaving Airbnb, I realized that I wouldn't necessarily advance as an engineer in the types of things I wanted to get better at unless it was at a special, unique place that would value a product engineer. I found that there were more career options in product roles that appealed to the types of things I wanted to be doing day-to-day, such as a very high level of thinking about products and making those products come to life. So when looking at other companies, I was open to both product and engineering roles, and I ended up finding a product role that worked well at Lyft.


### The PM role and team at Lyft 

At Lyft, I joined the bikes and scooters org, which was a new line of business, and that was great because it functioned like a start-up. I was a software PM, mainly focused on supporting the systems and processes with software to deliver the bikes and scooters that people would ride. When I joined, it was shortly after the company had acquired Motivate, which owned the New York City bike system and a few other bike shares. So it was an interesting setup, because on the one hand the Lyft team was very young, but we also added on this 80-person team that had been operating for around five years.

I was one of eight PMs, including people who were more involved in operations, and others who worked with hardware or integrating with the Lyft app. My area was mostly focused on how we managed all the interactions, like physically making sure that the bikes and scooters were well-maintained and that they were where they should be and delivered. 


### Coming into this new product role at Lyft, how did you even know what to do on a day-to-day basis?

I think there are a few different layers to this. At the basic level, there’s just checking the boxes. You know that the team needs a plan, and to create a plan, you need to have a planning session, and so you lead the team through these familiar rituals.

The superpower PM skills that I've acquired since then involve knowing how to prioritize. Your team might come up with a list of 120 ideas, but you can only realistically execute five or ten of them. To do this, you need to form a near-term and North Star vision, which is very challenging to articulate and balance against each other. For the stuff I worked on with Lyft, our North Star vision was truly magical, but in hindsight, it was impractical. We needed a more achievable North Star and a near-term vision that could build into it. 


### What were some challenges you faced when you made the switch from engineering to product at Lyft?

There was definitely a lot to ramp up on initially. In hindsight, I wish I had spent more time really understanding the extent to which we needed to invest in tooling and the most important features to be delivered. 

One thing that we did well was visiting the warehouses and markets, such as Gowanus, where CityBike was operated, as well as Denver, Austin, and DC, where we had scooters and bikes. By going to these places, we could get a better understanding of just how people interacted with the hardware and how they balanced looking at their phones while managing all the equipment.


### How did you balance your product vision with the larger product vision at Lyft?

At Lyft, it wasn’t so much of a problem because we were an independent line of business and not very large. My manager was the head of product for all bikeshare and scooters, and he reported to the CEO of Lyft. So managing up wasn't much of a challenge. I had a clear understanding of my team's role and occasionally synced up with PMs from the rider side. But in general, the swim lanes were clear. 

At Facebook, it's different. There are many layers above me, and there's a lot of toe-stepping and overlaps, making it necessary to manage up. Communication with leaders is essential to help with coordination and prioritization. They can determine if our area needs more investment or reallocate us to other areas that need it more. 


### What defines a PM’s work?

As a PM, a lot of my work is invisible to the team and others. I spend a significant amount of time building relationships with people on my team and other teams to get a sense of what they care about and how it aligns with our team's goals. This involves having one-on-one meetings with different people to understand their perspectives, goals, and priorities. For example, I might talk to an engineer who cares about having a clean software architecture or a product manager who has a specific goal metric for their team.

Another key responsibility of a PM is research. This includes not only researching my own team's product but also researching other teams' products and staying up-to-date with market trends. This involves a lot of reading, user research, and competitive analysis. For example, I might look at other apps on the market that aren't directly competing with ours but are fair substitutes in terms of providing entertainment for users. This could include things like watching TV or hanging out with friends. By understanding the market landscape and what our competitors are doing, I can get a sense of where the market is heading and how we can stay ahead.

All of this research and relationship-building feeds into our team's strategy. As a PM, I spend a lot of time writing and refining our team's goals and plans. This involves a lot of back-and-forth between myself and other stakeholders on the team. For example, I might propose a plan based on our team's strengths and impact potential, but a senior tech lead might provide feedback that causes us to refine our plan. The goal is to come up with a plan that everyone feels good about, and that aligns with the company's overall strategy. Once we have a plan in place, my job as a PM shifts to helping the team execute. This involves more hands-on work and is more visible to others.


### Do you recommend switching from engineering to product? Who do you think would be successful at making this transition, and who should perhaps reconsider or explore a different route for impact?

If you want to make the transition because you want to do engineering plus a couple of other things that engineers don’t typically do, make sure to have that conversation with your team/manager and see if there’s an opportunity to widen the scope of your role while staying in engineering.

On the other hand, if you want to make the transition because, "Oh, I really hate coding," then you should probably make the switch.

If you do decide to make the transition, set yourself up for success by making sure the team you’re joining as PM, really actually needs you, and that you can really help the team.
